The Dash app won first place ðŸ¥‡. It was developed for the Dash Holiday Challenge 2022. [Customer Churn](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113)  data was used. It analyzes customer churn behavior and uses a classification model to predict which customers are at risk of churn. By understanding and addressing the root causes of churn, we can work to retain valuable customers and improve the company's revenue and profitability. Our analysis has identified two main profiles:


- A <span style="color: red;">**high-risk profile**</span> for churn is a customer on a month-to-month contract, using Fiber Optic service, with electronic check as their payment method, and who does not subscribe to online services and  technical support services.

- A <span style="color: blue;">**low risk profile**</span> for churn is a customer on a two-year contract, using DSL as their Internet service, and who subscribes to online services or technical support.
