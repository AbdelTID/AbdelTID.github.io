It was developed for the Dash Holiday Challenge 2022. [Customer Churn](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113)  data was used. It analyzes customer churn behavior and uses a classification model to predict which customers are at risk of churn. By understanding and addressing the root causes of churn, we can work to retain valuable customers and improve the company's revenue and profitability. Our analysis has identified two main profiles:\n\n\n- A <span style=\"color: crimson;\">**high-risk profile**</span> for churn is a customer on a month-to-month contract, using Fiber Optic service, with electronic check as their payment method, and who does not subscribe to online services and  technical support services.\n\n- A <span style=\"color: green;\">**low risk profile**</span> for churn is a customer on a two-year contract, using DSL as their Internet service, and who subscribes to online services or technical support.\n           \n\n\n#### The Challenge contest\n\nBuild an impressive customer segmentation data app using the provided IBM [customer churn dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/telco-customer-churn-by-IBM.csv) . The app should provide insights on the relationship between churn and customers' characteristics, have a well-designed interface, and utilize data exploration and analysis techniques such as numerical methods, machine learning, prediction, classification, and optimization. Submit the app code and a link to the deployed app by midnight on Saturday, January 14 for a chance to win the Plotly Community Challenge.\n\nRead more on [Plotly Community](https://community.plotly.com/t/holiday-community-app-building-challenge/70393)\n\n#### My app solution\n\nThe App was designed in seven sections, as follows:\n\n- <span style=\"color: #5D3FD3\">Welcome</span> : Welcome page.\n\n![](img/wel.png)\n\n- <span style=\"color: #5D3FD3\">Customers</span> : Display customer information\n\n![](img/custm.png)\n\n- <span style=\"color: #5D3FD3\">Insights</span> : Give an overview of customers behavior. \n\n![](img/insg.png)\n\n\n- <span style=\"color: #5D3FD3\">Exploratory</span>: Show relationship between churn and monthly charges within customer caracteristiques.\n\n![](img/eda.png)\n\n- <span style=\"color: #5D3FD3\">Classification</span>: This section provides  model building and Churn prediction\n\n![](img/class.png)\n\n- <span style=\"color: #5D3FD3\">Summary</span>: Give a summary of the app. \n\n![](img/sum.png)\n\n- <span style=\"color: #5D3FD3\">About</span>: Who am I?.\n\n![](img/about.png)\n\n#### App won first place\n\n![](img/win.png)\n\nRead more on [Plotly Medium](https://medium.com/plotly/dash-club-9-new-gallery-community-app-winners-winter-challenge-partial-property-updates-29d352de7705#329d).\n\n##### View project website\n[https://live-abdelanlah-plotlydash-churn.onrender.com/](https://live-abdelanlah-plotlydash-churn.onrender.com/)\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nVery slow.
