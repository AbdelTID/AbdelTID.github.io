The app should provide insights on the relationship between churn and customersâ€™ characteristics, have a well-designed interface, and utilize data exploration and analysis techniques such as numerical methods, machine learning, prediction, classification, and optimization. Submit the app code and a link to the deployed app by midnight on Saturday, January 14 for a chance to win the Plotly Community Challenge.\nRead more on Plotly Community\n\n\nMy app solution\nThe App was designed in seven sections, as follows:\n\nWelcome : Welcome page.\n\n\n\nCustomers : Display customer information\n\n\n\nInsights : Give an overview of customers behavior.\n\n\n\nExploratory: Show relationship between churn and monthly charges within customer caracteristiques.\n\n\n\nClassification: This section provides model building and Churn prediction\n\n\n\nSummary: Give a summary of the app.\n\n\n\nAbout: Who am I?.\n\n\n\n\nApp won first place\n\nRead more on Plotly Medium.\n\nView project website\nhttps://live-abdelanlah-plotlydash-churn.onrender.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVery slow.
